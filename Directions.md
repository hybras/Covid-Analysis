# Project Directions

This directions guide is copy pasted / paraphrased from the pdf.

## Outline

The goal of this project would be to get experience in handling a current real-world data set.

1. Understand the datasets. You would want to understand the different variables that are involved, identify which ones are categorical/quantitative, and how the variables interact with each other.
2. You want to find appropriate visualizations for the data. This is typically called Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
3. You want to come with different questions/hypothesis that you want to ask/test. The questions and methods must be within the class's scope. Have multiple questions that are considered.
4. Use the data to derive answers and/or insights into the questions that you asked.

## Resources

1. Mentor/TA: Maia Karpovich
	1. Reach out to your mentors with specific questions, cross check your ideas, and
get feedback on your methods. Please make sure you take advantage of this resource.
2. Professor: Ya boi Jonathan
	1. Office Hours
	2. Email / Canvas Message
	3. 10 mins before lecture

## Grading

This project will comprise of 12% of the total course grade and is part of the Final Exam component.

1. Group interactions through Canvas
2. Spreadsheet to record individual ideas/suggestions and contributions.
3. 1.5min presentation in class, during lecture (tentatively) on December 10th, 2020.
4. Project guidelines describe in the sections: Outline and Important Notes.
5. Upload a single `.html` report on Canvas.

## Important Notes

This is collaborative, NOT competitive.

1. The ideas and questions you seek to answer do not have to be complicated.
2. This is NOT just a coding project.
Please leverage the diverse individual skills of all your group members in this collaborative setup.
3. Everyone in the group should feel comfortable voicing their ideas. Please make sure
that you create an inclusive and non-threatening environment when having group
discussions.
4. This is not a competition, so donâ€™t spend too much time judging your peers ideas,
there is room for many questions and different answers. This is not to say that you
cannot have disagreements, just make sure you keep them civil.
5. Any form of misbehaviour will not be tolerated. Please inform me right away if there
are any issues with members of your group.
