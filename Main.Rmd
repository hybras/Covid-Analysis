## Setup

Download data, install packages and load libraries

```{r, libs, include = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(gganimate)
library(gifski)
library(png)
library(ggrepel)
library(scales)
library(maps)
```

Download and read data.

```{r Initial_Data, collapse = TRUE}
base_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/raw/master/csse_covid_19_data/"

time_series_US_confirmed <- "csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv"

time_series_US_confirmed <- paste(base_url, time_series_US_confirmed, sep = "")
time_series_US_confirmed <- "./confirmed_US.csv"
time_series_US_confirmed <- read.csv(time_series_US_confirmed)
```

Get the data we *want*. Columns $\left[1,11\right]$ are locale identifiers. Columns $\left[12,\infty\right]$ are dates. The data is more granular that state, it goes down to town/county. We need to fix that. 

```{r clean_data}
last_column <- length(time_series_US_confirmed)
num_days <- last_column - 11 # someone needs to explain where this comes from.

# Data is more granular that state, it goes down to town/county. We need to group them together by state.
by_state <-
	time_series_US_confirmed %>% select(c(7, 12:all_of(last_column))) %>% group_by(Province_State) %>% summarize_at(vars(2:all_of(num_days)), sum)
# %>% adorn_totals('row') #idk what this does

# we are using another library for state names. it expects lower cases names
by_state$Province_State <-
	tolower(by_state$Province_State)

# get the contiguous/continental us states, including D.C.
cont_states <-
	map_data("state")$region %>% unique() 
# limit ourselves to continental US
by_state <-
	by_state %>% filter(Province_State %in%  cont_states) %>% dplyr::rename(region = Province_State) 

# get the dates in the format given to us: XM.DD.YY (the 'X' is a char literal of unknown purpose)
# Add 1 because we're starting from 2, to get the columns we need
# 2020/1/22 is the first date in the set
col_names <- colnames(by_state)[c(2:all_of(num_days + 1))]
new_col_names <-
	seq(as.Date("2020/1/22"), by = "day", length.out = num_days)
by_state <- by_state %>%
	setNames(new_col_names) %>%
	dplyr::rename(region = "2020-01-22")

#Prepare data for plotting, flatten the data
by_state.long_1 <- pivot_longer(
  by_state,
  cols = c(2:all_of(num_days)),
  names_to = "date",
  values_to = "cases"
)
```
